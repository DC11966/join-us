DEFCON Jeddah is a technical community that supports the open exchange of knowledge, whether it be on security, development, electronics, and anything technology related. If youâ€™re interested in sharing your knowledge, please review the process below, and let's start creating an impact in our community.

## tl;dr:
- Apply as a speaker
- Apply as a researcher
- Apply as a competetion organizer 
- Apply as a mentor
- Apply as an event organizer 

### Apply as a Speaker:
DEFCON Jeddah would love to feature a diverse speaker line-up covering a wide range of topics related to computer science and security. The submission can be for both virtual as well as the in-person events, and when you fill out the form you will be contacted to select which (or both) you are aiming for.

### Apply as a researcher
This is your call if you've been doing research in cybersecurity, or working as a bug bounty hunter. By applying as a researcher, you get to showcase your research and writeups to inspire others learn and do the same. 

### Apply as a competetion organizer 
Capture the Flag and Attack/defense competetions can be a great addition to our stack of events to evaluate skills and get recognition. If you've been participating, planning, writing, and creating security challenges, this is where you will excel and support our community the most.

### Apply as a mentor
If you're confident in a subject and you've been interested to teach and share your knowledge in any topic you're passionate about, let us get an overview of your skills and background and we will do the rest. We can connect you to a small group of people in our upcoming events, or plan a 1:1 with someone who is interested to learn from you. 

### Apply as an event organizer 
This is your place if you have people skills and you'd love to be the social butterfly who can help us understand what the community need, and find ways to fulfill those needs or come up with various options and ideas for our events.

Interested in any of the above? Awesome, please fill in the form if you want to get contacted: https://forms.gle/Hhiughnk3xANocSc7
